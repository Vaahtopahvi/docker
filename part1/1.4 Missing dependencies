First I ran ubuntu with a command:

docker run -d -it ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

then I entered to container with a command:

docker exec -it angry_keller bash

insdie container I installed curl with a command:

apt update && apt install curl -y

I opened 2nd terminal and attached a container:

docker attach angry_keller
